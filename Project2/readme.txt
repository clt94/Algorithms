To compile ConvexHull435.cpp: g++ ConvexHull435.cpp -o ConvexHull435

To run ConvexHull435: ConvexHull435 <J/G/Q depending on the algorithm to run> <filename with coordinates>

To time ConvexHull435: time ./ConvexHull435.exe <J/G/Q depending on the algorithm to run> <filename with coordinates>

This program will take a file and generate the convex hull using the Jarvis March, Graham Scan, and QuickHull taken from the coordinates input by the user. These coordinates are generated by ConvexHull_GUI.java. The hull is output to a text file with hull, the letter for the algorithm, and the shape and number of coordinates. 

Note these coordinates were generated using the program ConvexHull_GUI.java. If you wish to visualize them run then, edit the ConvexHull_GUI program so the coordinates are from the java program and the hull from the C++ program and set generateCoordinates to false.
